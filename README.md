# Ask me anything!

[Ask a question](../../issues/new) or [read questions](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc).

I get a lot of questions by email and social media. This way anyone can read the answer!

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.

## Guidelines

* Ensure your question hasn't already been asked / answered.
* Use a succinct title and description.
* Bugs & feature requests for my other projects should be opened on their respective repositories.
* Please be civil and polite.
